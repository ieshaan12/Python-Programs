    Use dir() to collect both instance attrs and names inherited from
    its classes; Python 3.X shows more names than 2.X because of the
    implied object superclass in the new-style class model; getattr()
    fetches inherited names not in self.__dict__; use __str__, not
    __repr__, or else this loops when printing bound methods!

    As one possible improvement to address the proliferation of inherited built-in names
    and long values here, the following alternative for ___attrnames in file listinherited2.
    py of the book exampleâ€™s package groups the double-underscore names separately,
    and minimizes line wrapping for large attribute values; notice how it escapes a % with
    %% so that just one remains for the final formatting operation at the end:
